# Improved-YOLOv5-for-building-detection

# Introduction:
This is the code for the article:"An Improved YOLOv5s Model for Building Detection", https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics13112197
We first collected a building dataset from real scenes and the internet, and applied an improved GridMask data augmentation method to expand the dataset and reduce the impact of occlusion. To make the model lightweight, we pruned the model by the channel pruning method, which decreases the computational costs of the model. Furthermore, we used Mish as the activation function to help the model converge better in sparse training.
